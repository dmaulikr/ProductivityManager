TODO:

Add About window

Add Preferences Window

Add Preferences:
Later: Add ability for user to use their own sound

Read in applications based on profile

Add some way to delete profiles

Add notifications based on applicaiton list

Get graphic for each application - display next to name
for this, we apparently need the full path to the application
This brings up quandry:
do we store dictionary of application name to full path of application or do we store array of full paths to applications and at display time do some fancy string manipulation?

implement the open at login vs. not

Add Sparkle?


Use algorithm:
every minute, check what application the user is using. If user is not using a productivity app, increase the count. If the count exceeds X (where X is based on strictness level), notify user.
Beware of bug: user changing strictness level when in Productivity Mode: if count is too high - app might show notification even if they are in a productivity mode - perhaps add a check for (count too high && currentApp is ! productivity)



bugs to fix

when user clicks on notificaiton (whether just clicking or when clicking the OK or Later buttons), make sure it sets the previous applicaiton as foreground

Application icon is not showing up in notifications

If close pref window, can't re-open it. Sometimes, attempting to re-open it causes a crash, other times it just does nothing
