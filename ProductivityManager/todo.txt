TODO:

Add About window

Add Preferences Window

Add Preferences:

Notifications go away automatically or need to be dismissed
List of applications that are considered "productivity" apps
    provide + and - buttons ---- when click +, get list of applications that are on the computer but allow to specify Other
    Do not allow user to set ProductivityManager as one of the Productivity apps
Strictness level    1 - 5

Play sound or not
    Later: Add ability for user to use their own sound
Open at login

Add timer - use pref time value

Read in applications from prefs

Add notifications based on applicaiton list

Add menu graphic

implement the open at login vs. not

Add Sparkle?


Use algorithm:
every minute, check what application the user is using. If user is not using a productivity app, increase the count. If the count exceeds X (where X is based on strictness level), notify user.
Beware of bug: user changing strictness level when in Productivity Mode: if count is too high - app might show notification even if they are in a productivity mode - perhaps add a check for (count too high && currentApp is ! productivity)



bugs to fix

when user clicks on notificaiton (whether just clicking or when clicking the OK or Later buttons), make sure it sets the previous applicaiton as foreground
