TODO:

Add Preference:
Later: Add ability for user to use their own sound

Read in applications based on profile

Add some way to delete profiles

Add Sparkle?


Use algorithm:
every minute, check what application the user is using. If user is not using a productivity app, increase the count. If the count exceeds X (where X is based on strictness level), notify user.
Beware of bug: user changing strictness level when in Productivity Mode: if count is too high - app might show notification even if they are in a productivity mode - perhaps add a check for (count too high && currentApp is ! productivity)



bugs to fix

Table is not refreshing when -reloadData is called

when user clicks on notificaiton (whether just clicking or when clicking the OK or Later buttons), make sure it sets the previous applicaiton as foreground
